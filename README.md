Stuff I'm currently working on.

## Enslaved by Aliens ##
2D pixel art metroidvania platformer made in the Godot game engine.

## Anonyverse ##
Anonymous location based social media platform. Apparently this name is "very boomer" and I should change it. :( Also anonyverse.com is taken and for sale for Â£15,000.

Laravel, React, Mapbox-gl, Tailwind.css. No need for Three.js anymore since Mapbox has a globe map.

You can spin the planet around and click anywhere to view posts around that area.
